# Tesla-Turbine-CAD-Design

The Tesla Turbine model is developed using Solidworks, an advanced CAD software, showcasing the design, assembly, and key component details. This project aims to explore the potential of bladeless turbines as alternatives to traditional turbine designs such as Francis, Pelton, and Kaplan.

Features

1.Detailed 3D CAD models of the turbine components
2.Assembly configurations demonstrating the working principle
3.Parametric design enabling easy modifications
4.Exported files compatible with various simulation and manufacturing software

Technologies Used

1.CAD Software: [Specify software, e.g., SolidWorks, AutoCAD, or Fusion 360]
2.File formats included: STEP, STL, SLDPRT (or other relevant formats)
3.Documentation with technical references and design considerations

How to Use

1.Browse the models folder to access detailed component files
2.Open assembly files in your preferred CAD program to explore the full turbine assembly
3.Modify parameters in parametric models for customized designs
4.Utilize exported files for simulation, visualization, or prototyping
